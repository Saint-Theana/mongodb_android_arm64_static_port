.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fI\%mongod\fP is the primary daemon process for the MongoDB
system. It handles data requests, manages data access, and performs
background management operations.
.sp
This document provides a complete overview of all command line options
for \fI\%mongod\fP\&. These command line options are primarily useful
for testing: In common operation, use the configuration file
options to control the behavior of
your database.

.INDENT 3.5
To prevent undefined behavior, specify a value for this

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The default value for the \fBlistenBacklog\fP parameter is set at
compile time to the target system \fBSOMAXCONN\fP constant.
\fBSOMAXCONN\fP is the maximum valid value that is documented for
the \fIbacklog\fP parameter to the \fIlisten\fP system call.
.sp
Some systems may interpret \fBSOMAXCONN\fP symbolically, and others
numerically. The actual \fIlisten backlog\fP applied in practice may
differ from any numeric interpretation of the \fBSOMAXCONN\fP constant
or argument to \fB\-\-listenBacklog\fP, and may also be constrained by
system settings like \fBnet.core.somaxconn\fP on Linux.
.sp
Passing a value for the \fBlistenBacklog\fP parameter that exceeds the
\fBSOMAXCONN\fP constant for the local system is, by the letter of the
standards, undefined behavior. Higher values may be silently integer
truncated, may be ignored, may cause unexpected resource
consumption, or have other adverse consequences.
.sp
On systems with workloads that exhibit connection spikes, for which
it is empirically known that the local system can honor higher
values for the \fIbacklog\fP parameter than the \fBSOMAXCONN\fP constant,
setting the \fBlistenBacklog\fP parameter to a higher value may reduce
operation latency as observed by the client by reducing the number
of connections which are forced into a backoff state.

.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP

New in version 3.4: Allows the \fBmongod\fP to accept and create authenticated and

performing rolling transition of replica sets or sharded clusters
from a no\-auth configuration to internal authentication\&. Requires specifying a internal
authentication mechanism such as
\fI\%\-\-keyFile\fP\&.

.sp
For example, if using keyfiles for
internal authentication, the \fBmongod\fP creates
an authenticated connection with any \fI\%mongod\fP or \fBmongos\fP
in the deployment using a matching keyfile. If the security mechanisms do
not match, the \fBmongod\fP utilizes a non\-authenticated connection instead.

New in version 3.4: Available in MongoDB Enterprise only.

.sp
A \fBmongod\fP running with \fI\%\-\-redactClientLogData\fP redacts any message accompanying a given
log event before logging. This prevents the \fBmongod\fP from writing
potentially sensitive data stored on the database to the diagnostic log.
Metadata such as error or operation codes, line numbers, and source file
names are still visible in the logs.
.sp
Use \fI\%\-\-redactClientLogData\fP in conjunction with
/core/security\-encryption\-at\-rest and
/core/security\-transport\-encryption to assist compliance with
regulatory requirements.
.sp
For example, a MongoDB deployment might store Personally Identifiable
Information (PII) in one or more collections. The \fBmongod\fP logs events
such as those related to CRUD operations, sharding metadata, etc. It is
possible that the \fBmongod\fP may expose PII as a part of these logging
operations. A \fBmongod\fP running with \fI\%\-\-redactClientLogData\fP removes any message
accompanying these events before being output to the log, effectively
removing the PII.
.sp
Diagnostics on a \fBmongod\fP running with \fI\%\-\-redactClientLogData\fP may be more difficult
due to the lack of data related to a log event. See the
process logging manual page for an
example of the effect of \fI\%\-\-redactClientLogData\fP on log output.

On a running \fBmongod\fP, use \fBsetParameter\fP with the
\fBredactClientLogData\fP parameter to configure this setting.

.sp
Starting in MongoDB 4.2.1 (and 4.0.14), you can specify multiple KMIP
servers as a comma\-separated list, e.g.
\fBserver1.example.com,server2.example.com\fP\&. On startup, the
\fI\%mongod\fP will attempt to establish a connection to each
server in the order listed, and will select the first server to
which it can successfully establish a connection. KMIP server
selection occurs only at startup.
.sp
When connecting to a KMIP server, the \fI\%mongod\fP
verifies that the specified \fI\%\-\-kmipServerName\fP matches the
Subject Alternative Name \fBSAN\fP (or, if \fBSAN\fP is not present, the
Common Name \fBCN\fP) in the certificate presented by the KMIP server.
If \fBSAN\fP is present, \fI\%mongod\fP does not match against
the \fBCN\fP\&. If the hostname does not match the \fBSAN\fP (or \fBCN\fP),
the \fI\%mongod\fP will fail to connect.
.sp
Starting in MongoDB 4.2, when performing comparison of SAN, MongoDB
supports comparison of DNS names or IP addresses. In previous versions,
MongoDB only supports comparisons of DNS names.
