New in version 4.4: MongoDB Enterprise

.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
Starting in version 4.4, MongoDB Enterprise provides
\fI\%mongokerberos\fP for testing MongoDB\(aqs Kerberos and GSSAPI
configuration options against a
running Kerberos deployment. \fI\%mongokerberos\fP can be used
in one of two modes: \fIserver\fP and \fIclient\fP\&.

T{
Server
T}	T{
In \fIserver mode\fP, \fI\%mongokerberos\fP analyzes
Kerberos\-related configurations on the server, and returns a
report which includes error messages for any configurations that
are problematic. For usage, see \fI\%Server Mode\fP
T}

T}	T{
In \fIclient mode\fP, \fI\%mongokerberos\fP tests Kerberos
authentication for a provided username, and returns a report
which includes the success or failure of each step in the
Kerberos authentication procedure. For usage, see
\fI\%Client Mode\fP

Generally, when configuring options related to
Kerberos authentication, it is good practice
to verify your configuration with \fI\%mongokerberos\fP\&.
.sp
\fI\%mongokerberos\fP is a testing and verification tool; it does not
edit any files or configure any services. For configuring Kerberos on
your platform please consult the \fI\%MIT Kerberos documentation\fP, or your platform\(aqs
documentation. For configuring MongoDB to authenticate using Kerberos,
please reference the following tutorials:

.SS Tip
.sp
Linux and macOS users may wish to copy \fI\%mongokerberos\fP to a filesystem
location that is defined in the \fB$PATH\fP environment variable, such
as \fB/usr/bin\fP\&. Doing so allows referencing \fI\%mongokerberos\fP directly
on the command line by name, without needing to specify its full
path, or first navigating to its parent directory. See the
installation guide for your platform
for more information.

.SH USAGE
.sp
\fI\%mongokerberos\fP can be run in two modes: \fIserver\fP and
\fIclient\fP\&.
.sp
Run \fI\%mongokerberos\fP from the system command line, not the \fBmongo\fP shell.
.SS Server Mode
.sp
Running \fI\%mongokerberos\fP in server mode performs a series of
verification steps against your system\(aqs Kerberos configuration,
including checking for proper DNS resolution, validation of the Kerberos
system keytab file, and testing against the MongoDB service principal
for your \fBmongod\fP or \fBmongos\fP instance.
.sp
Before you can use \fI\%mongokerberos\fP in server mode, you must:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
Configure Kerberos on your platform according to your platform\(aqs
documentation.
.IP 2. 3
Create the MongoDB service principal for use with your
\fBmongod\fP or \fBmongos\fP instance, as described
in the following steps:
.INDENT 3.0
.IP \(bu 2
Configure Service Principal on Linux
.IP \(bu 2
Configure Service Principal on Windows
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Once you have completed these steps, you can run
\fI\%mongokerberos\fP in server mode using the
\fB\-\-server\fP flag as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
mongokerberos \-\-server
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If Kerberos has been configured properly on the server, and the service
principal created successfully, the output might resemble the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C

The final message indicates that the system\(aqs Kerberos configuration is
ready to be used with MongoDB. If any errors are encountered with
the configuration, they will be presented as part of the above output.
.SS Client Mode
.sp
Running \fI\%mongokerberos\fP in client mode tests authentication
against your system\(aqs Kerberos environment, performing each step in the
Kerberos authentication process, including checking for proper DNS
resolution, verification of the Kerberos client keytab file, and testing
whether a ticket can be successfully granted. Running
\fI\%mongokerberos\fP in client mode simulates the client
authentication procedure of the \fBmongo\fP shell.
.sp
Before you can use \fI\%mongokerberos\fP in client mode, you must
first have configured Kerberos on your platform according to your
platform\(aqs documentation. Optionally, you may also choose to run
\fI\%mongokerberos\fP in
\fI\%server mode\fP first to verify that your
platform\(aqs Kerberos configuration is valid before using client mode.
.sp
Once you have completed these steps, you can run
\fI\%mongokerberos\fP in client mode to test user authentication,
using the \fB\-\-client\fP flag as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
mongokerberos \-\-client \-\-username <username>
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You must provide a valid username, which is used to request a Kerberos
ticket as part of the authentication procedure. Your platform\(aqs
Kerberos infrastructure must be aware of this user.
.sp
If the provided credentials are valid, and the Kerberos options in the
configuration files are valid, the output might resemble the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
 Resolving kerberos environment...
 [OK] Kerberos environment resolved without errors.

 Verifying DNS resolution works with Kerberos service at <hostname>...

   * KRB5_CLIENT_KTNAME: not set.
   * KRB5_CONFIG: not set.
   * KRB5_KTNAME: not set.
   * KRB5_TRACE: not set.
 [OK]

 Verifying existence of KRB5 client keytab FILE:/path/to/client.keytab...
 [OK] KRB5 client keytab exists and is populated.

.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-server
Runs \fI\%mongokerberos\fP in server mode to test that your
platform\(aqs Kerberos configuration is valid for use with MongoDB.
.sp
See \fI\%Server Mode\fP for example usage and expected
output.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-client
Runs \fI\%mongokerberos\fP in client mode to test client
authentication against your system\(aqs Kerberos environment. Requires
specifying a valid username with \fI\%\-\-username\fP when running in
client mode. \fI\%mongokerberos\fP will request a Kerberos ticket
for this username as part of the validation procedure. Running
\fI\%mongokerberos\fP in client mode simulates the client
authentication procedure of the \fBmongo\fP shell.
.sp
See \fI\%Client Mode\fP for example usage and expected
output.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-config <filename>, \-f <filename>
Specifies a configuration file for runtime configuration options.
The options are equivalent to the command\-line
configuration options. See /reference/configuration\-options for
more information.
.sp
\fI\%mongokerberos\fP will read the values for
\fBsaslHostName\fP and \fBsaslServiceName\fP from this
file if present. These values can alteratively be specified with the
\fI\%\-\-setParameter\fP option instead.
.sp
Ensure the configuration file uses ASCII encoding. The
\fI\%mongokerberos\fP instance does not support configuration
files with non\-ASCII encoding, including UTF\-8.
.sp
Only valid in \fI\%server mode\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-setParameter <options>
Sets a configurable parameter. You can specify multiple
\fBsetParameter\fP fields.
.sp
While you can use any supported parameters with \fBsetParameter\fP,
\fI\%mongokerberos\fP only checks for the value of the following:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBsaslHostName\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBsaslServiceName\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
If using the \fI\%\-\-config\fP option with a configuration file that
also contains these values, the \fBsetParameter\fP values will
override the values from the configuration file.
.sp
Valid in both \fI\%server mode\fP
and \fI\%client mode\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-host <hostname>
Specify the hostname of the MongoDB server to connect to when testing
authentication.
.sp
If \fI\%\-\-host\fP is not specified, \fI\%mongokerberos\fP does
not perform any DNS validation of the hostname (i.e. PTR record
verification)
.sp
Only valid in \fI\%client mode\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-username <username>, \-u <username>
