.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
For a sharded cluster, the \fI\%mongos\fP
instances provide the interface between the client applications and the
sharded cluster. The \fI\%mongos\fP instances route queries and
write operations to the shards. From the perspective of the
application, a \fI\%mongos\fP instance behaves identically to
any other MongoDB instance.
.SH CONSIDERATIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Never change the name of the \fI\%mongos\fP binary.
.IP \(bu 2
Starting in version 4.4, \fI\%mongos\fP
can support hedged reads to minimize
latencies.
.IP \(bu 2
Starting in version 4.0, MongoDB disables support for TLS 1.0
encryption on systems where TLS 1.1+ is available. For
more details, see 4.0\-disable\-tls\&.
.IP \(bu 2
Starting in MongoDB 4.0, the \fI\%mongos\fP binary will crash when
attempting to connect to \fBmongod\fP instances whose
feature compatibility version (fCV) is greater than
that of the \fI\%mongos\fP\&. For example, you cannot connect
a MongoDB 4.0 version \fI\%mongos\fP to a 4.2
sharded cluster with fCV set to 4.2\&. You
can, however, connect a MongoDB 4.0 version
\fI\%mongos\fP to a 4.2 sharded cluster with fCV set to 4.0\&.

.B \-\-maxConns <number>
The maximum number of simultaneous connections that \fBmongos\fP will
accept. This setting has no effect if it is higher than your operating
system\(aqs configured maximum connection tracking threshold.
.sp
Do not assign too low of a value to this option, or you will
encounter errors during normal application operation.
.sp
This is particularly useful for a \fI\%mongos\fP if you have a client
that creates multiple connections and allows them to timeout rather
than closing them.
.sp
In this case, set \fBmaxIncomingConnections\fP to a value slightly
higher than the maximum number of connections that the client creates, or the
maximum size of the connection pool.

.B \-\-redactClientLogData
New in version 3.4: Available in MongoDB Enterprise only.

.sp
A \fBmongos\fP running with \fI\%\-\-redactClientLogData\fP redacts any message accompanying a given
log event before logging. This prevents the \fBmongos\fP from writing
potentially sensitive data stored on the database to the diagnostic log.
Metadata such as error or operation codes, line numbers, and source file
names are still visible in the logs.
.sp
Use \fI\%\-\-redactClientLogData\fP in conjunction with
/core/security\-encryption\-at\-rest and
/core/security\-transport\-encryption to assist compliance with
regulatory requirements.
.sp
For example, a MongoDB deployment might store Personally Identifiable
Information (PII) in one or more collections. The \fBmongos\fP logs events
such as those related to CRUD operations, sharding metadata, etc. It is
possible that the \fBmongos\fP may expose PII as a part of these logging
operations. A \fBmongos\fP running with \fI\%\-\-redactClientLogData\fP removes any message
accompanying these events before being output to the log, effectively
removing the PII.
.sp
Diagnostics on a \fBmongos\fP running with \fI\%\-\-redactClientLogData\fP may be more difficult
due to the lack of data related to a log event. See the
process logging manual page for an
example of the effect of \fI\%\-\-redactClientLogData\fP on log output.
.sp
On a running \fBmongos\fP, use \fBsetParameter\fP with the
\fBredactClientLogData\fP parameter to configure this setting.

A comma\-separated list of SASL mechanisms \fBmongos\fP can

libraries by default. Defer to the documentation associated with each
SASL mechanism for guidance on installation and configuration.

By default, \fBmongos\fP creates a TLS/SSL secured connection to the LDAP

For Linux deployments, you must configure the appropriate TLS Options in
\fB/etc/openldap/ldap.conf\fP file. Your operating system\(aqs package manager

For Windows deployment, you must add the LDAP server CA certificates to the

For each document in the array, you must use either \fBsubstitution\fP or
\fBldapQuery\fP\&. You \fIcannot\fP specify both in the same document.
.sp
When performing authentication or authorization, \fBmongos\fP steps through
each document in the array in the given order, checking the authentication
username against the \fBmatch\fP filter.  If a match is found,
\fBmongos\fP applies the transformation and uses the output for
authenticating the user. \fBmongos\fP does not check the remaining documents
in the array.
.sp
If the given document does not match the provided authentication
name, \fI\%mongos\fP continues through the list of documents
to find additional matches. If no matches are found in any document,
or the transformation the document describes fails,
\fI\%mongos\fP returns an error.
.sp
Starting in MongoDB 4.4, \fI\%mongos\fP also returns an error
if one of the transformations cannot be evaluated due to networking
or authentication failures to the LDAP server. \fI\%mongos\fP
rejects the connection request and does not check the remaining
documents in the array.

A user with username \fBbob@DBA.EXAMPLE.COM\fP matches the second document.
The regex capture group \fB{0}\fP corresponds to the string \fBbob\fP\&.  The
