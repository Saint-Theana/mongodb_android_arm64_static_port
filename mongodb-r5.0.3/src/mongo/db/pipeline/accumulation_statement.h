/**
 * AccumulatorExpression represents the right-hand side of an AccumulationStatement. Note this is
 * different from Expression; they are different nonterminals in the grammar.
 *
 * For example, in
 *     {$group: {
 *         _id: 1,
 *         count: {$sum: {$size: "$tags"}}
 *     }}
 *
 * we would say:
 *     The AccumulationStatement is      count: {$sum: {$size: "$tags"}}
 *     The AccumulationExpression is     {$sum: {$size: "$tags"}}
 *     The AccumulatorState::Factory is  $sum
 *     The argument Expression is        {$size: "$tags"}
 *     There is no initializer Expression.
 *
 * "$sum" corresponds to an AccumulatorState::Factory rather than AccumulatorState because
 * AccumulatorState is an execution concept, not an AST concept: each instance of AccumulatorState
 * contains intermediate values being accumulated.
 *
 * Like most accumulators, $sum does not require or accept an initializer Expression. At time of
 * writing, only user-defined accumulators accept an initializer.
 *
 * For example, in:
 *     {$group: {
 *         _id: {cc: "$country_code"},
 *         top_stories: {$accumulator: {
 *             init: function(cc) { ... },
 *             initArgs: ["$cc"],
 *             accumulate: function(state, title, upvotes) { ... },
 *             accumulateArgs: ["$title", "$upvotes"],
 *             merge: function(state1, state2) { ... },
 *             lang: "js",
 *         }}
 *     }}
 *
 * we would say:
 *     The AccumulationStatement is      top_stories: {$accumulator: ... }
 *     The AccumulationExpression is     {$accumulator: ... }
 *     The argument Expression is        ["$cc"]
 *     The initializer Expression is     ["$title", "$upvotes"]
 *     The AccumulatorState::Factory holds all the other arguments to $accumulator.
